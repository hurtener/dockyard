# `approval-flows` — write-side walkthrough

The `approval-flows` template is the canonical Tasks × Apps Dockyard
example. Two contract-first task-augmented tools driving a
human-in-the-loop round-trip from inside an iframe. The write-side
counterpart to [`analytics-widgets`](analytics-widgets).

## Scaffold

```bash
dockyard new my-approvals \
  --template approval-flows \
  --dockyard-path /path/to/dockyard   # pre-publish only
cd my-approvals
```

The scaffold produces a project with:

```text
my-approvals/
├── README.md
├── dockyard.app.yaml          # two tools (task_support: required) + one App
├── main.go                    # boots a real tasks.Engine (D-135)
├── internal/
│   ├── contracts/             # RequestApproval{Input,Output}, ProposeWithEdits…
│   └── handlers/              # the handlers drive the input_required round-trip
├── fixtures/                  # six fixtures per tool
└── web/
    └── src/
        ├── App.svelte         # renders the approval card / edits form
        └── …
```

## The two tools

| Tool                  | What it does                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `request_approval`    | Pause for human approval of a single decision; returns approved/rejected + reason. |
| `propose_with_edits`  | Propose structured changes (fields with current + proposed values); the user edits and approves. |

Both declare `task_support: required` — the `input_required` round-trip
is the product, not an optional capability. The scaffolded `main.go`
attaches a real `tasks.Engine` (decision
[D-135](/reference/decisions)) so the tools run as durable tasks against
the real `runtime/server`.

## Run + inspect

```bash
# One-time after a pre-publish scaffold:
go mod tidy

# A template scaffold ships the Go contracts but not the generated
# JSON Schema + TS — produce them once:
dockyard generate

dockyard build
DOCKYARD_TRANSPORT=http dockyard run

# In another terminal:
dockyard inspect --url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --dir .
```

Fire `request_approval` from the Tools tab. The App renders an approval
card; click Approve. The Tasks tab walks the lifecycle through the
`input_required` round-trip:

![request approval](/screenshots/phase-25/request-approval.png)

`propose_with_edits` renders a form whose proposed values are editable;
approve with edits sends the user's values back through the bridge:

![propose with edits](/screenshots/phase-25/propose-with-edits.png)

The Tasks panel renders each task's lifecycle as a Timeline:

![tasks panel](/screenshots/phase-25/tasks-panel-live.png)

The inspector body is 100vh with scrollable regions (the
phase-25 layout fix):

![full vh layout](/screenshots/phase-25/layout-fullvh.png)

## How the round-trip works

1. Host calls `tools/call request_approval` → server returns a
   `CreateTaskResult` because the tool is task-augmented.
2. Handler runs as a `TaskHandle`; calls
   `handle.RequestInput(...)` → task moves to `input_required`.
3. App renders the approval card, reads the prompt from
   `hostContext`. User clicks Approve.
4. App sends a `ui/elicitation-response` bridge notification
   ([D-134](/reference/decisions)) → inspector relays it to the server
   via `tasks/result`.
5. Handler's `RequestInput` returns with the user's payload; the
   handler completes the task with the final structured output.

The Tasks panel renders the whole sequence as a Timeline so you can
correlate UI events with task state transitions.

## Capability degradation

If the host hasn't negotiated the Tasks capability, the handler returns
a synchronous "requires interactive host" stub instead of crashing
(RFC §7.5, the capability-driven rule from
[AGENTS.md §6](https://github.com/hurtener/dockyard/blob/main/AGENTS.md)).
Flip the capability toggle in the inspector to test the degradation
path.

## Adapt it

- Replace the synthetic approval logic with your real decision flow —
  the handlers' `TaskHandle.RequestInput` API is the integration point.
- Wire to a real auth context — the scaffold opts
  `RequestorIdentifiable=false` on stdio (single-user); on HTTP plug a
  bearer-token resolver into `WithTasks`.
- Add more fields to the edits form — extend the
  `ProposeWithEditsInput.Fields` slice; the App's `FieldDiff` component
  composes the editable current → proposed pair from `web/ui/`.
